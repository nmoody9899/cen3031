This repository holds the code used for the Consider Herbs web application. This code was developed by students (Team 5 - BMSS Tech) at the University of Florida in the Spring 2021 Introduction to Software Engineering Course (CEN3031).

Consider Herbs aims to educate and show people healthy and natural ways on how to take control of their own well-being. In order to accomplish this, Consider Herbs requires a storefront for users to purchase products, submit testimonials, and view relevant information to educate them on healthy lifestyles.
